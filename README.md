Star tracker location computation and post processing

This program is used with a DSLR camera that gives good images of the stars.
you take pictures and post process them in here, then, tries to guess your location using the USNO conscise method

The concise method is stored in analysisAndPlots/maps/ST.py
The image processing is stored in analysisAndPlots/astro/client/centerPixelMethod.py

It's coming along.

I love my lab partners
